    <p>Lorde released her third album, Solar Power, in the fall of this year -- although, arguably, it was probably summer somewhere in New Zealand so the name befits the release date. But what took so long? And why is there such a discrepancy between, to put it technically, the vibes or Solar Power and Melodrama. And why did Melodrama slap so hard? These questions must be answered but alas I will not be doing that</p>
